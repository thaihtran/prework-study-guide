Prework study guide for boot camp.
# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Wanting to demonstrate the skills that I learned from my prework modules and creating a simple HTML webpage. 

This project was built to help organize my notes on the different lanuages that I will be learning : HTML, CSS, Git & JavaScript.

Being able to add on additional notes and information that I learn for each languages will help keep things organized.

From creating this project, I learned how precise each code has to be, from forgetting to capitalize a letter to something as simple as adding a space can make a code invalid.
